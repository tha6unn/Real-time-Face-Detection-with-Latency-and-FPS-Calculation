# Real-time-Face-Detection-with-Latency-and-FPS-Calculation
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenVINO (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) toolkit. The model is trained to detect faces in a video stream and provides information about latency and frames per second (FPS) rate.
